Pick a TV show that had its premieres on TV and thus has some viewership numbers reported on Wikipedia.
E.g. [Suits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Suits_episodes) (see table just above the References)

Then create a short report (you can copy the content from Wikipedia or other pages for this task) that contains, for example (do a commit after each step!):

1. A brief description of the show (use _italics_ for names).
2. A photo with the logo or a shot from the show itself.
3. A summary of some basic statistics (e.g. on viewership or ratings).
4. A graph of the viewership over time.
5. A graph of the episode-to-episode (or season-to-season) changes in viewership.
6. A short description of the observed changes that includes inline references to numbers (e.g. the viewership decreased by `insert_calculated_number` between seasons 3 and 5).
7. Make sure your report looks nice -> this time we're mostly interested in the output and not necessarily the codes used to achieve it.
7. `knitr` your report and save it in the "RMarkdown folder" of your repo. 
8. Commit the changes and push them to Github.


# A brief description of the show
_The Big Bang Theory_ is an American comedy television series created and executively produced by _Chuck Lorre_ and _Bill Prady_. Like the name of the series itself (with the exception of the first episode _"Pilot"_), episode titles of _The Big Bang Theory_ always start with _"The"_ and resemble the name of a scientific principle, theory or experiment, whimsically referencing a plot point or quirk in that episode.

# A photo with the logo of the show

# A summary of some basic statistics
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(knitr)
tbbt_data <- read_delim("Data/tbbt_data.csv", 
    ";", escape_double = FALSE, col_types = cols(overall_number_of_episode = col_integer()), 
    trim_ws = TRUE)
knitr::kable(summary(tbbt_data))
```

# A graph of the viewership over time
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(tbbt_data, aes(x=overall_number_of_episode, y=us_viewers_in_mln)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title='A graph of the viewership over time', x='Overall number of episodes', y='US viewers in mln') +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = round(seq(min(tbbt_data$overall_number_of_episode), max(tbbt_data$overall_number_of_episode), by = 25),1))
```
